# FMCG Warehouse Optimization (Regression + Classification)

Forecast optimal shipment weight to warehouses and flag overstock risk using Python.  
**Regression:** Ridge Regression (Test R² ≈ 0.9745, RMSE ≈ 1850 tons).  
**Classification:** KNN (K=1) with Test Error ≈ 0.2%, Sensitivity ≈ 0.996, Specificity ≈ 0.999.

## Problem
A fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm faced stockouts in some regions and excess inventory in others. We model shipment volume and segment warehouses to guide logistics and inventory planning.

## Data
Dataset: [Supply Chain Optimization for a FMCG Company](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj9727/supply-chain-optimization-for-a-fmcg-company)  

Key features include:  
- Retail shop count  
- Refill requests  
- Transport/storage issues  
- Hub distance  
- Zone and warehouse capacity  

---

## Methods
- **EDA & Feature Engineering:** log/sqrt transforms, interaction terms (e.g., shop density × refill)  
- **Regression:** OLS + subset selection (forward/backward/best), Ridge & Lasso comparison → Ridge chosen for robustness  
- **Classification:** Logistic (convergence warnings), LDA, KNN (K=1) → KNN chosen (lowest error, no instability)  

---

## Results
- **Ridge Regression:** Test R² ≈ 0.9745, RMSE ≈ 1850 tons  
- **KNN (K=1):** Test Error ≈ 0.2%, Sensitivity ≈ 0.996, Specificity ≈ 0.999  

**Key shipment drivers (from Ridge):**  
- Storage issues (+) → strongest positive driver  
- Transport issues (–) → reduce allocation  
- Retail density × refill frequency (+) → increases shipment volume  
- Location, zone, and capacity → contextual effects

## 🧑‍💻 Role
- Collaborated on data sourcing, cleaning, and preparation  
- Responsible for building and evaluating the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier  
- Conducted model comparisons between **Logistic Regression, LDA, and KNN**, analyzing test error, sensitivity, and specificity  
- Summarized results to support the final selection of KNN as the best classification model for inventory risk detection
